# Worksheet

## A. Course introduction
Follow along with Jay's introductory presentation to the course.

## B. Introduction to Matlab
1. Complete short introductory presentation
2. Explore the interface layout. Know the name of each panel, and briefly describe what they do.
### B.1. Basic command window operation
1. **Create numeric variables using the command window
-- Assign custom names to variables
2. Create row vectors, column vectors and matrices
 ***hint***: *use brackets [ ] to generate vectors and matrices, commas or spaces to separate values in the same row, and  semi-colons to indicate new rows.*
-- Create an **m x 1** column vector (e.g. [4; 3; 1; 3; 1])
-- Create a **1 x n** row vector
-- Create an **m x n** matrix
3. Insert not-a-number (NaN) into a vector or matrix to indicate a missing (or null) value.  
***note:*** The value NaN is a special character recognized by MATLAB as a null value. Any normal operations that are carried out on variables containing NaNs will result in NaN.
4.  Use indexing to reference specific items in a matrix
***example***: d = matrix1(2,3) creates a variable *d* containing the value in the second row and third column of *matrix1*  
***example2***: e = matrix1(:,3) creates a variable *e* containing all values in the third column of *matrix1*
